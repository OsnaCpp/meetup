## Ideas

* Virtual coffee breaks over video chat (maybe in a dedicated channel which is always open)
* do not be afraid to catcall people when you would have visited their desk

## Mindset

* [Time Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management)
* Wear normal clothing which you would wear to work as well
* keep private and work life as separate as possible
* invent rituals (e.g. going for a walk to simulate commuting to work)
* take proper break (not at your desk)
