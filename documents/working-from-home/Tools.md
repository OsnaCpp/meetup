## Ideas

* Virtual coffee breaks over video chat
* do not be afraid to catcall people when you would have visited their desk

## Mindset

* keep private and work life as separate as possible
* invent rituals (e.g. going for a walk to simulate commuting to work)
* take proper break (not at your desk)
